## Git Strategy - Git Flow

<img src="/media/GitFolwStrategy.png">

### Git Structure
This project follows a mono-repo structure. 
* This means that all code, documentation, and resources are stored within this single repository.

### Git Organisation and Management
#### Branches:
* main: This branch contains the final, production-ready code.
    * No direct commits are permitted and all changes must come in a pull-request from a release branch.
* develop: All current development happens in this branch. This includes features, tests and fixes.
* feature: Feature branches are branched off the develop branch to add functionalities and to fix bugs.
* documentation: This is the branch used for documentation related content and layout commits.
* hotfix: This branch is created when a quick or crucial changes need to be made once all repo branches are merged into the main.

#### Pull Request Workflow:
1. Developers create feature branches from the develop.
2. Upon the completion of a feature, a pull-request into develop is created.
3. Automated lints and tests are used to validate changes.
4. A pull-request must be reviewed by at least 1 other team member before merging into develop.

#### Code Review Process:
Reviews focus on checking that coding standards are being followed and that any issues brought on by miscommunication are cleared up early on.

        <p>
          A computer science student majoring in data science, brings a strong focus on
          artificial intelligence and data structures to the team. His proficiency in Java, Python, and
          RStudio, along with his expertise in NoSQL databases, will be invaluable in developing the
          SmartInventory system's data management and analysis components. Bryce's keen
          interest in becoming a data scientist aligns perfectly with the project's goal of
          incorporating advanced features such as demand forecasting and inventory optimization.
          Bryce's ability to work well in teams and his willingness to contribute to all aspects of
          programming, including areas outside his specialties, demonstrate his adaptability and
          commitment to the project's success. His strong problem-solving skills and ability to
          adapt to new challenges will be essential in navigating the complexities of the
          SmartInventory project and ensuring its timely delivery.
