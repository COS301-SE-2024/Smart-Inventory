# Architectural Specification

## Introduction

### Objectives
The primary objective of this document is to guide stakeholders involved in the development of the Smart Inventory System. It aims to define the architectural framework, constraints and technologies used to successfully implement the desired features and functionalities. 

## Quality Requirements

### 1. Security

The system must ensure data protection through end-to-end encryption, secure user authentication, and role-based access control to prevent unauthorized access and maintain data confidentiality.

### 2. Reliability

The system should be reliable in terms of accurately tracking inventory levels, generating timely alerts, order placement and generating accurate reports.

### 3. Usability

The web interface should be user-friendly and intuitive for administrators, inventory controllers, and end users to perform their respective tasks efficiently.

### 4. Scalability

The system should be designed to handle growth in inventory, users, and transactions, ensuring that performance remains optimal as the business expands.

### 5. Maintainability

The system should be developed using best practices, such as modular design and comprehensive documentation, to facilitate easy maintenance, updates, and troubleshooting.

## Architectural Strategies

The team has decided to apply the strategy of design based on quality requirements for the project. Analyzing the system based on client requirements and user stories yields a large set of quality requirements to use for the project. A set of well defined quality requirements yields a good foundation for designing the architecture of the system.

## Architectural Styles
### Layered Architecture

#### Description
The SmartInventory system will employ a layered architecture, separating the application into distinct layers such as presentation, business logic, and data access. This promotes a clear separation of concerns, making the system more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand. The presentation layer will handle the user interface, the business logic layer will contain the core application logic, and the data access layer will manage interactions with the database.

#### Quality Requirements Addressed

Maintainability:
* The layered architecture facilitates easier maintenance by isolating changes to specific layers, reducing the impact on the overall system.
  
Scalability:
* Layers can be scaled independently based on the demands of the system, allowing for optimal performance as the business grows.

Usability:
* The presentation layer can be designed to provide a user-friendly interface.

Security:

### Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) 

#### Description
The system will be designed using SOA principles, breaking down the functionality into discrete, loosely coupled services. Each service will encapsulate a specific business capability, such as inventory management, order placement, or reporting. Services will communicate through well-defined interfaces, enabling flexibility and reusability.

#### Quality requirements addressed

Scalability: 
* Services can be scaled independently, allowing the system to handle increased load and adapt to changing business needs.
  
Maintainability:
* SOA promotes loose coupling, making it easier to update or replace individual services without affecting the entire system.
  
Reliability:
* Services can be designed with fault tolerance and redundancy in mind, ensuring the system remains operational even if individual components fail.

### Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
#### Description
The SmartInventory system will incorporate event-driven architecture to enable real-time responsiveness and asynchronous processing. Key events, such as low stock levels or expiring products, will trigger appropriate actions, such as generating alerts or initiating automatic order placement.

#### Quality Requirements addressed

Reliability: 
* EDA allows for asynchronous processing, ensuring that critical events are handled promptly and reliably, even under high load.
  
Scalability:
* The event-driven approach enables the system to scale efficiently by processing events in parallel and distributing the workload across multiple components.


## Architectural Constraints
A core architectural constraint for this project is the requirement to **utilize only open-source libraries**. This decision fosters an open-source development philosophy for the project itself. This contraint might actually provide greater advantages than disadvantages. Here's why this constraint is important:

* Transparency and Collaboration:
  * Open-source libraries offer the advantage of publicly available code.
  * This transparency allows for deeper understanding, easier debugging, and potential contributions from the broader developer community.
* Alignment with Open-Source Project Goals:
  * By relying solely on open-source libraries, we ensure compatibility with an open-source project philosophy.
  * This means the project itself can potentially be released as open-source, allowing others to benefit from and contribute to its development.
* Long-Term Sustainability:
  * Open-source libraries often have active communities and ongoing maintenance.
  * This reduces the risk of relying on proprietary libraries that might become unsupported or unavailable in the future.

While this constraint might limit the available options for libraries, the benefits of transparency, collaboration, and long-term sustainability contribute to a robust and maintainable project foundation.
